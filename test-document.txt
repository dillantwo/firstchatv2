This is a test document to verify the file upload functionality.

The new file upload system supports:
1. Images (JPG, PNG, GIF, etc.)
2. Word documents (.docx)
3. PDF files (.pdf)

For Word and PDF documents, the system will:
- Extract the text content
- Send the text to the AI model instead of using base64 encoding
- Display a document icon instead of image preview
- Show document content in the preview modal

This approach is more efficient than base64 encoding for text documents.
